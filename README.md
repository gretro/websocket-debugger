# Websocket Debugger
Websocket Debugger is a Chrome extension that allows developers to debug easily Websocket network traffic. To work correctly, this project relies on multiple parts.

 - A library containing an implementation of a Websocket Proxy.
 - A Web Application using the library's proxy in order to communicate through the websocket.
 - A Chrome extension that will listen and record traffic so users can consult it.
